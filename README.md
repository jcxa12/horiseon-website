### Description

With the following modifications, I sought to improve the accessibility standards of the website in order to optimize the results in search engines.

### Modifications

* Changed value "title" from "title" to "Horiseon | Marketing agency".

* Organized the HTML file separating header and footer from body.

* Added an "alt=" value to "img".

* Changed "background-colour" value for classes "header", "benefits", "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", "social-media-marketing" from #d9dcd6 to #668ea1.

* Changed "background-colour" value for class "header h1 .seo" from #d9dcd6 to #bce98f.

* Applied "border-style=groov" for clases "benefits","search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management" and "social-media-marketing".

* Linked options "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing" to HTML file "Horiseon-ComingSoon.html" which opens in a new tab.

* Upload image coming.soon.xxx and linked to Horisseon-ComingSoon.html

* Created a README.md file
